## **Imperative Conjugation**

The **Imperative** conjugation is used to order someone or give instructions to do something. This conjugation can only be used with **Action** verbs.

Look at the following example using the verb "To Think": "Mikiro".

Or the following example, giving an instruction using the verb "To press": "Neka"

### **Ex:**
