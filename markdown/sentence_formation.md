# Sentence Formation

## Standard Sentences

In most cases, sentences in Noku follow a similar structure to English sentences.

**Ex:**

> I want coffee. -\> Ako nalo fosi.

However, sentences in Noku are bound by certain rules depending on the type of sentence.

Normal sentences always follow a Subject-Verb-Object structure:

**Ex:**

> I am a nice person. -\> Ako mai ang nindo imaniti.
> 
> Well, I love you. -\> Owu, ako ame kayo.
> 
> Owu ako ame kayo -\> THIS IS **INCORRECT** (X).

## Questions

Questions follow a Question Word / Conditional (if any) - Verb - Subject - Object structure:

**Ex:**

> How are you doing? -\> Gama mai tako lakan?

Keep in mind that this applies to all questions. So when translating from English to Noku, you may have to switch things around or add things.

**Ex:**

You did that? -\> Lakananon tako eto?

Did what? -\> Apo lakananon ako?
