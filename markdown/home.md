Welcome to the **Official Noku to English Dictionary** , made by yours truly. This should serve as an aid for making sentences and possible conversations in Noku.

Noku was created as an attempt to create a simpler, new language with sensible and simple rules and structure. It should be easy for an English native to use. It would simply require knowing the appropriate words and rules.

Noku utilizes the most of the letters in the standard Latin alphabet, having 23 letters. There are no accents or special characters.

If you would like to skip the rules, simply go to the Words section. You can find the appropriate page number in the Index on the previous page.
