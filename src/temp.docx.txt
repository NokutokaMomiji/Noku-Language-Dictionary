Introduction


Welcome to the Official Noku to English Dictionary, made by yours truly. This should serve as an aid for making sentences and possible conversations in Noku. 


Noku was created as an attempt to create a simpler, new language with sensible and simple rules and structure. It should be easy for an English native to use. It would simply require knowing the appropriate words and rules.


Noku utilizes the most of the letters in the standard Latin alphabet, having 23 letters. There are no accents or special characters.


If you would like to skip the rules, simply go to the Words section. You can find the appropriate page number in the Index on the previous page.

Cardinal numbers

	One Thousand
	Mien
	1000000
	One Million
	Milien
	10000000
	One Billion
	Bilien
	



These are the basic cardinal numbers. With these, you can make up any number you need. To make a number, simply string the numbers together.


Ex: 
23 -> Bi + Tri = Bitri.
102 -> Sien + Bi = Sienbi.
200 -> Bi + Sien = Bisien.


*In the cases of numbers that end with a “t”, if the next word starts with a consonant, you add the letter “i” between the words.
Ex:
72 -> Sept + bi = Septibi


Ordinal Numbers


In order to turn a number from Cardinal to Ordinal, simply add the suffix “-iet” at the end. Take a look at the following table:


Number
	Cardinal
	Ordinal
	0
	Sero
	Seroiet
	1
	Mon
	Moniet
	2
	Bi
	Biet
	3
	Tri
	Triet
	4
	Kuat
	Kuatiet
	5
	Pint
	Pintiet
	6
	Hixo
	Hixoiet
	7
	Sept
	Septiet
	8
	Okto
	Oktoiet
	9
	Nove
	Noveiet
	10
	Dien
	Dieniet
	20
	Bidien
	Bidieniet
	100
	Sien
	Sieniet
	1000
	Mien
	Mieniet
	1000000
	Milien
	Milieniet
	10000000
	Bilien
	Bilieniet
	



The suffix is only added at the end of the number, not between numbers. 


Ex:
32 -> Bitri + -iet -> Bitriet


















________________
Pronouns


There are three categories of pronouns in Noku: Direct, Indirect and Possession. Each category is made up of 7 pronouns.


Direct pronouns are pronouns used to refer to the subject of the sentence. As previously stated, there are 7 pronouns.


Person
	Number
	English
	Noku
	1st Person
	Singular
	I
	Ako
	*Plural (Inclusive)
	We
	Ano
	*Plural Exclusive
	We
	Ani
	2nd Person
	Singular
	You
	Tako
	Plural
	You
	Tano
	3rd Person
	Singular
	He / She / They
	**Mako
	Plural
	They
	Mano
	

*The inclusive pronoun includes the listener (you and me / us). The exclusive pronoun excludes them (me / us but not you).
**Noku is a gender-less language, meaning there are no gendered words or pronouns.


Indirect pronouns are pronouns used to refer to an object which is not the subject of the sentence.


Person
	Number
	English
	Noku
	1st Person
	Singular
	Me
	Iko
	Plural (Inclusive)
	Us
	Ino
	Plural (Exclusive)
	Us
	Ini
	2nd Person
	Singular
	You
	Kayo
	Plural
	You
	Kano
	3rd Person
	Singular
	Them
	Siyo
	Plural
	Them
	Sino
	





If the verb is in Imperative, you use the Indirect pronoun. 
Ex: 
“Give me some coffee.” -> “Dadara iko seto foci.”




Possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession of an object or item.


Person
	Number
	English
	Noku
	1st Person
	Singular
	Mine
	Ma
	Plural (Inclusive)
	Our / Ours
	Mon
	Plural (Exclusive)
	Our / Ours
	Mion
	2nd Person
	Singular
	Your / Yours
	Ka
	Plural
	Your / Yours
	Kon
	3rd Person
	Singular
	His / Hers / Theirs
	Sa
	Plural
	Theirs
	Son
	



To refer to an inanimate object, you can use the pronoun “ito” (Direct and Indirect) and “itos” (Possessive).


________________
Verb Conjugation


Verbs in Noku are easy to conjugate. There are four types of verb conjugation in Noku: Present, Past, Future and Imperative. To demonstrate every conjugation type, we will be using the verb “To Be”: “Mai”


The Present conjugation is used to indicate that an action is happening in the current moment. This conjugation merely utilizes the verb root and is the same as the infinitive form.


Ex:
I am -> Ako mai.
You are -> Tako mai.
He / She is -> Mako mai.




The Past conjugation is used to indicate that an action happened previous to the current moment. This conjugation is done by appending the suffix “-anon” to the verb root.


Ex:
I was -> Ako maianon.
You were -> Tako maianon.
He / She was -> Mako maianon.




The Future conjugation is used to indicate that an action will happen in the, well, future. This conjugation is done by appending the suffix “-rian” to the verb root.


Ex:
I will be -> Ako mairian.
You will be -> Tako mairian.
He / She will be -> Mako mairian.


The Imperative conjugation is used to order someone or give instructions to do something. This conjugation can only be used with Action verbs. This conjugation is done by simply repeating the first syllable, or first consonant and vowel in certain cases, before the root verb. Look at the following example using the verb “To Think”: “Mikiro”.


Ex:
Think, Gura! -> Mimikiro, Gura!


Or the following example, giving an instruction using the verb “To press”: “Neka”


Ex:
Press [Z] to interact. -> Neneka [Z] interako.


The imperative conjugation can only be used with either a noun, as done in the previous example, or with the 2nd Person Direct Pronoun (either singular or plural).




The Present conjugation is also used as the present participle of the word.


Ex:
I was being nice! -> Ako maianon mai nindo!


The Past conjugation is also used as the past particle of the word.


Ex:
I had warned you. -> Ako milikianon amaranon kayo.
________________


Sentence Formation
Standard Sentences


In most cases, sentences in Noku follow a similar structure to English sentences. 


Ex:
I want coffee. -> Ako nalo fosi.


However, sentences in Noku are bound by certain rules depending on the type of sentence. 




Normal sentences always follow a Subject-Verb-Object structure:


Ex: 
I am a nice person. -> Ako mai ang nindo imaniti.
Well, I love you. -> Owu, ako ame kayo.


Owu ako ame kayo -> THIS IS INCORRECT (X).






































Questions


Questions follow a Question Word / Conditional (if any) - Verb - Subject - Object structure:


Ex: 
How are you doing? -> Gama mai tako lakan?


Keep in mind that this applies to all questions. So when translating from English to Noku, you may have to switch things around or add things.


Ex: 
You did that? -> Lakananon tako eto?
Did what? -> Apo lakananon ako?
